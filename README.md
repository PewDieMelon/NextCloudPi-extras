# NextCloudPi-extras
My extra steps to add on a clean NextCloudPi installation.

Currently the script contains 3 parts:
- correcting drive mounting
- installing and activating ClamAV
- installing Imagemagick for HEIF thumbnail support

Visually step 1 and 2 are not seperated within the script because man, protect your files!
